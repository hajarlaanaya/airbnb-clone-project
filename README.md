A high-level Python web framework that allows rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It handles URL routing, user authentication, and provides tools for building RESTful APIs.

### 🗄️ PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database system used to store and manage application data. It works seamlessly with Django through the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
